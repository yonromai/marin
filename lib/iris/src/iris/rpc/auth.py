"""Iris's RBAC policy over the generic ``rigging.server_auth`` framework.

The mechanism — verifying a token, binding the per-request identity, the
authenticator stack and the Connect interceptors — lives in
``rigging.server_auth``. This module holds only what is Iris-specific: the role
semantics. It names the privileged actions and the role each requires, the
read-only allowlist for the ``dashboard`` role, and the cookie the dashboard
authenticates browsers with, and it reads the identity ``rigging.server_auth``
bound for the request to enforce them.
