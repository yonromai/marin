"""Local Grug MoE backend using Tri Dao's QuACK SM100 kernels (SonicMoE) on B200.

Dispatch/combine as in ``scatter``, but the expert MLP GEMMs run on QuACK's
gated and plain SM100 GEMMs via the vendored ``cutlass.jax.cutlass_call``
shim. QuACK does all four activation-path grouped GEMMs (gate/up fwd fused with
SwiGLU, down fwd, and the ``dh``/``dx`` backward matmuls); the SwiGLU backward is
elementwise in JAX; the two weight-gradient GEMMs (``dw13``/``dw2``) stay on XLA
``ragged_dot``, reached through its transpose, which is where the contraction runs over the
ragged dimension. QuACK covers ~2/3 of the MoE FLOPs.

``_expert_mlp_quack_wgrad`` is the same forward with those two weight gradients also on QuACK,
through its varlen-k grouping, which is faster than ``ragged_dot`` at the hero shapes. That is
the path the ragged all-to-all EP backend takes, so on the hero every grouped GEMM in the expert
MLP is one kernel family.

# down GEMM. CLC persistence adds a further 1.049x / 1.120x at that tile. Under CLC the two

    The FSDP weights arrive H-sharded over ``data_axis_name`` (``moe_w13_local`` is [E, H/data, 2I],
    ``moe_w2_local`` is [E, I, H/data]). Dispatch runs ONCE (``_prepare_moe_dispatch`` sorts every
    local (token, expert) assignment by expert, so experts ``[lo, hi)`` are a contiguous segment of
    the sorted buffer). For each static chunk we all-gather only that chunk's expert weights (a
    ``1/chunks``-size collective, so chunk k+1's gather fits the scheduler's overlap-memory budget and
    can hide under chunk k's GEMM), slice the matching token segment, run the QuACK grouped GEMM over
    just that segment, and scatter-accumulate the outputs.

    Segment handling (see the module docstring on ``_expert_mlp``): the QuACK kernel and the XLA
    ``ragged_dot`` weight-grad path both index rows relative to row 0 of the buffer they are given, so
    each chunk gets a segment-relative ``x_dispatch`` (sliced to start at ``cu[lo]``) with a rebased
    ``cu_c``. Each chunk's segment length is a STATIC ``capacity`` that scales with its expert count
    (``total_assignments * size / num_experts``, 1x balanced, drop overflow), so the per-chunk
    capacities sum to ``total_assignments`` exactly as the uniform case does. ``chunk_sizes`` need not
    be equal: e.g. ``(16, 16, 96)`` runs two small gathers, which start the expert GEMMs quickly,
    followed by one large gather that overlaps them.
    Rows past the chunk's real assignments are folded into the last expert group (so the kernel never
    leaves ungrouped garbage rows) but weight-masked to zero, so they contribute nothing to the
    forward output and route a zero cotangent back to the router in the combine backward.
