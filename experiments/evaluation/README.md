# Evaluation launcher

A one-command path from "model + eval suite" to recorded results. Pick a registered model or supply a
catalog-schema model file, then select registered or file-backed evaluations. The launcher sizes a
serving slice and submits one CPU orchestrator job for the whole launch. The orchestrator serves the
model once, runs every selected eval against that endpoint in order, and writes one durable
`record.json` per eval as it finishes -- so a suite fills in progressively, each eval independently
inspectable (own record, own eval-child job and logs, own parquet), all sharing a `group_id`. Evaldash
scans those records into its Postgres query index.

`marin.evaluation.runner` opens one candidate `remote_inference` session and optionally one shared
hosted-judge session, then passes their Iris endpoint URLs to each executor. An evaluation failure is recorded and later evaluations continue. If inference fails,
the current and remaining evaluations are recorded as infrastructure failures. This directory holds
the model and suite catalogs, Marin fleet policy, and CLI choices.

The user-facing [evaluation guide](../../docs/tutorials/run-lm-evals.md) contains model-specific
commands, suite constraints, launch controls, and result locations.

## Commands

Run through the module:

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch --model qwen3-8b --evals smoke
```

`launch` submits one run per resolved eval key; a suite expands to its member evals. Unless
`--no-wait`, it waits for each object-store record and prints its metrics:

```bash
# See the resolved plan without submitting anything.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch --model qwen3-8b --evals smoke --dry-run

# Evaluate an export without adding it to the model catalog.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch \
  --model-config /path/to/fresh-rl-checkpoint.yaml --evals smoke --dry-run

# One suite, a specific slice, capped instances, no waiting.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch --model llama3.1-8b-instruct \
  --evals gsm8k --accelerator v6e-8 --limit 128 --no-wait

# GPU-only model routes to its CoreWeave peer automatically.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch --model snowball --evals gsm8k-smoke

# Override GPU placement and scheduling priority.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch --model snowball --evals gsm8k-smoke \
  --federated_cluster cw-rno2a --priority interactive

# Co-host one judge for every Harbor verifier in this batch.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch \
  --model qwen3-8b \
  --platform gpu \
  --judge-model qwen3.5-122b-a10b-fp8 --judge-accelerator H100x8 \
  --harbor-config experiments/evaluation/configs/harbor/simpleqa-hosted-judge.yaml \
  --federated_cluster cw-rno2a --limit 2
```

Key options: exactly one of `--model` or `--model-config` selects a registry entry or a catalog-schema
YAML/JSON file. `--evals` takes a suite name (`smoke`, `core`) or comma-separated eval keys
(`gsm8k,mmlu-smoke`); repeatable `--evalchemy-config` and `--harbor-config` options add evaluator-native
files; `--platform tpu|gpu` overrides the model's default; `--accelerator` overrides the sizing
heuristic with an exact slice (`v6e-8` or `H100x8`); `--limit` caps eval instances;
`--judge-model` or `--judge-model-config` selects an optional managed judge for Harbor
verifiers, and `--judge-accelerator` overrides its slice; the judge must colocate with the candidate;
`--federated_cluster` overrides the GPU fleet's target cluster; `--priority` sets the Iris priority
band for the orchestrator and serve jobs; `--records-prefix` overrides where records land. The
launcher always submits through the `marin` Iris controller.

Suites: `smoke` is a fast cluster check (capped mmlu cut + capped gsm8k). `core` is the comprehensive
per-model benchmark set (`CORE_EVALS` in `evals.py`: mmlu, gsm8k, arc-challenge, hellaswag,
winogrande, truthfulqa, boolq, piqa, openbookqa at OpenLLM-v1 shot counts, plus humaneval and
math500): one model boot, eleven evals against the shared endpoint, eleven records — the dashboard
shows the full model x task grid of runs.

Before upgrading a store, run the non-destructive smoke command on its platform. This CoreWeave
example selects one sealed v1 archive with sample rows and no more than 256 MiB of FineStore data,
copies only its FineStore objects to a same-bucket one-day prefix, migrates the copy, and compares
every source object and deduplicated table row with the v2 `ReadView`:

```bash
uv run iris --config lib/iris/config/marin.yaml job run --no-wait \
  --target-cluster cw-us-east-02a \
  --job-name finestore-v1-v2-smoke --cpu 2 --memory 8GB --disk 10GB \
  --enable-extra-resources --sync-package marin-core --extra cpu --timeout 1800 -- \
  python -m experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli smoke-upgrade \
  --records-prefix s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/evals
```

The final `status=validated` JSON records the source and temporary destination, object and byte
counts, an aggregate source digest, per-table row counts and digests, and the v2 commit token. The
source remains format v1. A failed run leaves only lifecycle-managed temporary data for inspection.

Use the fleet rehearsal before changing the production archives. It scans both current and legacy
CoreWeave record roots, deduplicates shared results paths, and selects every sealed v1 archive. A dry
run reports the exact selection and refuses to proceed if a record is unreadable. Unsealed v1
archives are included in the rehearsal as stable snapshots, while production migration continues to
require a seal:

```bash
uv run iris --config lib/iris/config/marin.yaml job run --no-wait \
  --target-cluster cw-us-east-02a \
  --job-name finestore-v1-v2-fleet-inventory --cpu 2 --memory 8GB --disk 10GB \
  --enable-extra-resources --sync-package marin-core --extra cpu --timeout 1800 -- \
  python -m experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli smoke-upgrade-fleet --mode inventory
```

The full rehearsal clones each selected archive beneath one generated `tmp/ttl=1d` fleet root and
independently compares every copied object and deduplicated Arrow row. `--mode cleanup` removes that
exact root only after every archive validates; an error or early exit preserves the partial fleet
for diagnosis until its lifecycle expiry:

```bash
uv run iris --config lib/iris/config/marin.yaml job run --no-wait \
  --target-cluster cw-us-east-02a \
  --job-name finestore-v1-v2-fleet --cpu 4 --memory 32GB --disk 20GB \
  --enable-extra-resources --sync-package marin-core --extra cpu --timeout 14400 -- \
  python -m experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli smoke-upgrade-fleet --mode cleanup
```

After the platform smoke passes, upgrade the sealed archive fleet before deploying a format-v2
evaluation reader. The migration publishes existing Parquet shards through `HEAD` and does not copy
their payload data:

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli upgrade-format --prefix gs://marin-eval-metadata/evals
```

`backfill-samples` rewrites every run's per-sample parquets from its kept `samples_*.jsonl` sources --
useful after a change to the contract in `finestore.eval` (the parquet files are
regenerated in place; the source jsonl is untouched):

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli backfill-samples --prefix gs://marin-eval-metadata/evals
```

A task scored under several extraction filters (gsm8k under `strict-match` and `flexible-extract`)
stores one sample per (document, filter); the two disagree by design. The dashboard's sample browser
shows one filter at a time, defaulting to the one that produced the run's headline metric, with a
selector for the others.

## Records and the dashboard index

Every eval writes `{records_prefix}/{run_id}/record.json` (`marin.evaluation.records`). That record
is the source of truth: normalized model configuration, hardware, status (`succeeded` / `failed` /
`artifact_failed` / `infra_failed`), the per-task metrics, provenance, normalized evaluator configuration,
the `group_id`
shared by every eval from the same serve, and the iris job paths of every job behind the run (`jobs`:
orchestrator, the shared inference child, this eval's child). The orchestrator writes it on success
and on failure, so a failed run is still accounted for -- and a failure carries the failed child's
last 100 log lines (`log_tails`), so most failures are diagnosable straight from the record (or the
dashboard) without cluster access.

For vLLM runs, `inference_metrics` contains the cumulative counter delta for that evaluator's window
on the shared server. It includes prompt tokens, generation tokens, elapsed time, and generation
tokens per second. A speculative run also includes draft count, proposed and accepted token counts,
mean acceptance length, and draft acceptance rate. The normalized model configuration in the same
record pins the target identity, tokenizer identity, and optional draft identity.

Within its FineStore archive, each evaluator writes individually scored questions to the `samples`
table using `EvalSample`, the shared schema in `finestore.eval`. Evalchemy writes its native
aggregate JSON and `--log_samples` JSONL directly as FineStore source artifacts. Harbor preserves
its native results and trajectories and writes flattened trajectory steps to the `steps` table; its
ordinary job tree remains resume state. Load the normalized tables with
pandas/duckdb, or read rows back with `EvalSample.model_validate`, to zoom into any run.

Evaldash treats these records as the source of truth. Its background ingestor scans every configured
object-store prefix and upserts the `eval_runs` and `eval_metrics` tables implemented in
`infra/marina/apps/evaldash/results_db.py`. Evaluation launchers do not read DB config or connect to Postgres.

## Evals in pipelines

`pipeline.py` exposes the same run as an `ArtifactStep`. Pass a checked-in `ModelConfig` directly to
`eval_step(models()["qwen3-1.7b"], "smoke", version="2026.07.19")`. The step submits the
same CPU orchestrator used by the CLI and writes eval outputs to the launcher's shared `evals` root;
its artifact path contains the pipeline cache record. The slice
override is a runtime arg, so changing it does not change the artifact identity.

For produced models, pass the producer handles in `deps` and resolve their locations in
`resolve_model(ctx)`. Use `ArtifactStep.adopt` when a model already exists outside the graph.
The resolver returns a plain `ModelConfig` with the target URI and identity; a drafted arm also
sets `ServeConfig.speculative` with the resolved draft URI, identity, method, and proposal length.
Control, initial-draft, and trained-draft arms use the same `eval_step` function. SkyRL experiments
resolve terminal policy metadata in their experiment resolver. No extra model-metadata step runs.

The resulting `EvaluationResult.results_paths` tuple points at the sealed FineStore archives in run
order. Downstream offline rollout processing should depend on this typed result instead of rebuilding
archive paths from run IDs.

## Evalchemy config files

Use repeatable `--evalchemy-config` options to launch portable Evalchemy YAML or JSON without adding
entries to `EVALS`. Each file is one evaluation and produces one record. Files can select Evalchemy
chat benchmarks or lm-eval tasks through the same `tasks` list:

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch \
  --model qwen3-8b \
  --evalchemy-config experiments/evaluation/configs/evalchemy/ifeval.yaml \
  --dry-run
```

The checked-in `mmlu-pro`, `gpqa-diamond`, `cruxeval`, `financebench`, `ifeval`, `ifbench`, and
`mrcr` files preserve Marin's publication-policy defaults. They are registered by name, so select
them with `--evals` or `eval_step`; they belong to no suite, and the `chat` suite remains the
shorter general-purpose selection. The policies were validated on H100. GPQA Diamond's seeded requests are
not compatible with the TPU vLLM backend.

Marin decodes the `evalchemy_config.EvaluationConfig`-compatible fields without importing Evalchemy.
The evaluation child then invokes the `evalchemy` console script from the pinned external runtime.
A dry run checks the YAML shape and the resolved Marin launch plan; task availability is checked when
the Evalchemy process starts. [evalchemy#67](https://github.com/marin-community/evalchemy/issues/67)
tracks a CLI validation mode that can move task-catalog errors back before Iris submission.

`tasks` selects one or more evaluator task names. Use `task_options.<task>` for `num_fewshot`,
`task_alias`, `generation`, `unsafe_code`, and `completion_only`; the remaining portable fields include
`apply_chat_template`, `limit`, `batch_size`, `seed`, `gen_kwargs`, `extra_model_args`, `max_length`,
and `max_tokens`. `runtime_extras` names optional Evalchemy dependency groups required by custom task
packages, such as `ifeval`. `apply_chat_template` defaults to the model catalog when omitted; an
explicit file value overrides it. The model catalog supplies generation overlays, and an explicit
launcher `--limit` overrides the file limit. `record.json` stores the resulting task
options and normalized Evalchemy launch configuration under `eval.tasks` and `eval.evalchemy`; the
record provenance stores the exact Evalchemy requirement, including runtime extras. FinanceBench
also requires a `judge` block with a dedicated endpoint, model, and secret reference. Marin forwards
those values as `JUDGE_*` variables while preserving the local candidate endpoint credentials. The
record stores the judge endpoint and model, but omits its credential reference and resolved value.

`--evalchemy-config` is additive with registry `--evals` and file-backed `--harbor-config`. The
launcher preserves argument order by source: registry entries, Evalchemy files, then Harbor files.
When no selection option is supplied, the launcher uses `smoke`; any file-only launch suppresses that
default.

## Agentic benchmarks (Harbor)

The `agentic` suite (`tb2`, `swebench`, `gaia`, `bfcl`, `aider`, `medagentbench`, `financeagent`) runs
in-sandbox agentic benchmarks through the same launcher. Each preset names an `hf://` repository whose
root contains Harbor task directories. Harbor resolves that repository at its configured
revision, the launcher serves the model once and mints a capability URL for the served endpoint, and
an in-sandbox terminal agent (Daytona) reaches the model through that URL. Harbor's verifier scores
each trial, which normalizes into one agentic `EvalSample` (reward ->
`Grading(method="harbor:verifier")`, trajectory -> `trajectory_uri`) plus a record, so agentic runs
land in evaldash like every other eval.

```bash
# A capped agentic validation run (2 tasks).
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch --model qwen3-8b --evals tb2-lite
```

Use `--harbor-config` to launch a Harbor `JobConfig` without adding it to `EVALS`:

```bash
# Serve Qwen3-8B and run the checked-in two-task AIME Harbor policy.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch \
  --model qwen3-8b \
  --evals gsm8k-smoke \
  --harbor-config experiments/evaluation/configs/harbor/aime-smoke.yaml \
  --limit 2
```

`--harbor-config` is repeatable and additive with `--evals`, so one served model can run registry
entries and file-backed Harbor policies in the same launch. When neither option is supplied, the
launcher uses the `smoke` suite; a file-only launch does not add that default. The launcher validates
all selected YAML and JSON files against Marin's pinned Harbor `JobConfig` before opening an Iris client.
File-backed launches support one agent and one dataset; multiple agents, multiple datasets, and
explicit `tasks` are rejected.

The pinned subprocess returns deterministic policy JSON, a SHA-256 digest, and dataset/agent/environment
metadata. Marin treats the JSON as opaque. At execution it supplies a separate overlay for `job_name`,
`jobs_dir`, the served model, endpoint, local dataset path, model-catalog kwargs, and `--limit`.
The isolated driver applies that overlay to typed Harbor models and validates the complete effective job
before calling Harbor. Policy agent kwargs override model-catalog kwargs; endpoint, model, output path,
local source, and an explicit `--limit` are reserved runtime values.

Write Hugging Face sources as `datasets[].name: hf://org/repository` with an optional `ref`; do not put
an `hf://` URI in `datasets[].path`. Local `path` values must be relative to the config file, must name
an existing directory inside the Marin workspace, and must be included in the Iris workspace bundle.
The launcher records the workspace-relative path so the submitted worker resolves the same directory
under its unpacked workspace. Absolute paths, unknown fields, malformed provider kwargs, and unsupported
file extensions fail before Iris submission.

The checked-in `swebench-recovery`, `ot-tblite-recovery`, `tb2-recovery`,
`simpleqa-recovery`, and `ds-1000-local` files preserve retry and resume policies for longer agentic runs.
They are file-backed policies rather than registry entries. A `recovery` name denotes an exact-identity
resume policy; each benchmark retains its own retry count and exception taxonomy. `ds-1000-local`
expects the generated Harbor task tree at `experiments/evaluation/local_datasets/ds1000`; create that
tree with Harbor's DS-1000 adapter before launching it.

Harbor and `harbor_config` are absent from Marin's environment and root lock. Both preflight and execution
install the exact `marin.external_dependencies.HARBOR` revision in an isolated uv environment. Every
Harbor record stores the deterministic source-policy digest in `eval.harbor.config_digest` and any
Marin runtime task cap in `eval.harbor.task_limit`. A policy's own `n_tasks` remains represented by
the digest.

Daytona-backed definitions declare one experiment-owned credential specification. A launch first
uses `DAYTONA_API_KEY` from its environment, then falls back to the `DAYTONA_EVAL_API_KEY` secret in
the `hai-gcp-models` Google Secret Manager project. `DAYTONA_API_KEY` is the only supported
environment override; the old `DAYTONA_EVAL_API_KEY` environment alias is not read. The generic
launcher resolves the declaration immediately before Iris submission, and the isolated Harbor
subprocess receives that key without inheriting the orchestrator's other credentials.

Every Harbor catalog policy is YAML under `experiments/evaluation/configs/harbor/`, named after its
`EVALS` key. Python retains the catalog and suite membership, Evalchemy definitions, model and hardware
selection, runtime task caps, and secret source declarations. The OT-TBLite profile runs its YAML
policy through the same path:

```bash
# One OT-TBLite trial with the step-1903 Grug SFT and OpenCode on H100x8.
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.cli launch \
  --model grug-agentic-s3-step1903 --evals ot-tblite --limit 1
```

Harbor downloads the `DCAgent/dev_set_v2` snapshot at the pinned Hugging Face commit and loads its
task directories.

Mechanism code lives under `marin.evaluation.evalchemy` and `marin.evaluation.harbor`; the common
runner depends only on the callable executor protocol and the shared record types.

## Adding a model or eval

A model is a `ModelConfig` (`marin.evaluation.model_config`): its `location` (HF id or `gs://`/`s3://`
export), a `resource_hint: ResourceHint` (placement compatibility), a `serve: ServeConfig` (server
behavior), a `generation: GenerationConfig`
(`--gen_kwargs`), and an `agent: AgentConfig` (Harbor agent kwargs). Two population paths feed the one
cached `models()` registry in `models.py`:

- **YAML catalog** under `serve/models/<org>/<model>.yaml` -- one file per model, decoded by draccus
  against `ModelConfig` (an unknown or mistyped field fails at load). This is the bulk catalog; see
  `serve/models/README.md` for the schema. Just add a file.
- **Python factory** in `models.py` for the parametric entries whose serve options are computed
  (`_snowball`, `_base_hf`) or the curated hand-tuned ones.

Set `resource_hint.hbm_gb` to a portable serving footprint, or set
`resource_hint.gpu` to an accepted exact GPU shape such as `{"H100": 8}`. The experiment fleet maps
that requirement to a cluster. Host memory is sized from the checkpoint's weight files and the
slice's rank count, so set `resource_hint.memory` only when a model needs more than its weights
imply. Set `tokenizer` when `location` is an object-store export because the eval client loads
its tokenizer through Hugging Face. vLLM streams object-store weights through the RunAI loader.
Every explicit `serve` value wins over what `auto_serve_overrides` derives from the model's
`config.json`; `generation.extra_gen_kwargs` (e.g. `skip_special_tokens=false` for a thinking model)
rides on `--gen_kwargs`.

Add a same-named Evalchemy YAML file under `configs/evalchemy/` and add its name to
`_STANDARD_EVALCHEMY_EVALS` in `evals.py`, or add a Harbor `JobConfig` YAML under `configs/harbor/`
and reference it with `harbor_definition()`. Add the key to `SUITES` when it belongs in a named group.
Task flags that matter for served evals:
`generation` routes the task through the chat API for chat-template models (MCQ tasks always use
completions, which alone can echo prompt logprobs); `unsafe_code` passes lm-eval's
`--confirm_run_unsafe_code`; and `completion_only` pins a generation task to the completions API.

For a benchmark under Evalchemy's `eval/chat_benchmarks` tree, set `runtime_extras` to its matching
Evalchemy extra so the endpoint and grading dependencies are installed without rebuilding an image.
The isolated client also installs CPU-only PyTorch as a compatibility floor; inference remains in
the separately served model process.
