# Loom production deployment

The `marin-loom` Pulumi stack manages `loom.oa.dev`: its GCE host with a
retained Hyperdisk root disk, Artifact Registry repository, Secret Manager
access, and Cloudflare DNS. The production host is an on-demand C4D VM with an
AMD Turin CPU. It uses NVMe for its boot disk and gVNIC for networking, as
required by the machine family. Hyperdisk performance is pinned to the included
3,000 IOPS and 140 MB/s baseline. The runtime is built from the operator's local
Loom worktree and runs as a Docker Compose application on the GCE host.

## Prerequisites

`Pulumi.yaml` selects the shared Marin state backend. The deploy command selects
the production stack explicitly.

The `loom-oa-dev` GitHub App must be installed on the repositories Loom serves.
Its private key, webhook secret, and client secret belong only in the
`LOOM_DOTENV` Secret Manager secret. The App callback and webhook URL use
`https://loom.oa.dev`. Its organization permissions must grant **Members:
Read-only** so Loom can verify private `Open-Athena` membership during sign-in
and hourly revalidation.

Authenticate Pulumi's providers and the local Docker client:

```sh
gcloud auth configure-docker us-central1-docker.pkg.dev
```

The deploy command loads the Cloudflare provider token from Secret Manager. The
local Docker builder must support `linux/amd64`.

Activation restarts the host's startup script over SSH. Create the Compute
Engine key pair once so the key is present and propagated before deploying;
activation fails immediately when `~/.ssh/google_compute_engine` is missing
rather than stalling while `gcloud` generates and propagates a new key.

```sh
gcloud compute ssh loom --zone=us-central1-a --project=hai-gcp-models
```

## Deploy

By default, Pulumi resolves the HEAD of Loom's default branch to its full commit
SHA and uses that immutable Git context as the image input. When the resolved
commit changes, preview reports an image update. `pulumi up` builds and pushes
the changed image, places the provider-produced digest in VM metadata, and waits
for `https://loom.oa.dev/api/ready` after activation.

```sh
cd /path/to/marin
uv run --all-packages --extra deploy marin-deploy loom rollout
```

Set `buildContext` to a Loom worktree to deploy local changes instead. The local
build includes tracked and untracked files allowed by that worktree's
`.dockerignore`; review its diff before deployment. The deploy command applies the
override through a temporary stack config, so later deployments return to the remote
HEAD automatically.

```sh
uv run --all-packages --extra deploy marin-deploy loom rollout \
  --config buildContext=/path/to/loom
```

Pulumi renders the Compose and Caddy configuration into VM metadata. The GCE
startup unit stores Docker state on the persistent root disk, reads one numbered
`LOOM_DOTENV` version, pulls the digest-pinned image, runs
`docker compose up -d`, applies the configured Loom deployment policy, and
checks readiness. It does not clone a repository or build images on the VM.

The host applies the deployment manifest with a request from inside the Loom
container to its loopback listener. Loom accepts that local request only for
`deployment.reconcile`, even when shared-deployment mode disables general
loopback trust. Caddy marks every forwarded request with `X-Loom-Forwarded`,
and session containers reach Loom through Docker networking rather than that
loopback listener. The request uses no deployment token or secret version.

## Update secrets

Do not put secret values in Pulumi configuration or state. Upload a reviewed
dotenv payload to Secret Manager, record the returned numeric version, and pin
that version in the stack:

```sh
gcloud secrets versions add LOOM_DOTENV \
  --project=hai-gcp-models --data-file=/path/to/reviewed.env
pulumi config set --cwd /path/to/marin/infra/loom --stack marin-loom \
  dotenvSecretVersion "$SECRET_VERSION"
```

Delete the local payload after upload. The startup script never reads `latest`,
so uploading another secret version does not change the running service.

## Automation identities

Runtime profiles and workload federation mappings live in
`Pulumi.marin-loom.yaml` and are applied through Loom's deployment API during
activation. The deployment setting
`auth.github_organizations: Open-Athena:188075292` binds admission to the
organization's immutable GitHub id. An active member receives the `user` role
at GitHub sign-in and a one-hour authorization lease. Loom revalidates the
membership before the lease expires with a short-lived GitHub App installation
token; it does not retain the user's OAuth token.

Only an active result renews access. Removal from the organization, a GitHub
outage, a timeout, or a permission failure invalidates the user's browser and
session credentials and closes sessions they own. Signed `@loom` requests use
the same policy and can revalidate a stale lease. Loom retains the identity row
for history and later re-admission, but that row is not an approval. An
administrator can explicitly convert an organization-derived user to manual
authorization in **People & security**. Enabling organization authorization
permanently latches this database into shared-deployment mode. Clearing the
setting, removing users, or completing workloads never restores implicit
loopback or machine-token administration.

`github.trigger_allowed_user_ids` grants signed GitHub issue and PR triggers
to the listed numeric GitHub identities. It does not bind those identities to
Loom users or grant browser sign-in, so existing account roles are unchanged.
Remove an ID from the setting to revoke this trigger grant.

The `grafana-alerts` federation mapping authorizes the Google
identity of the existing `marin-grafana` Cloud Run service account to select
only the `ops` profile. The profile names `marin-community/marin` in
`githubRepositories` because Grafana launches the operator session in that
repository and automation profiles receive only their configured repository
credentials. Without that entry, Loom rejects the launch with HTTP 428 before
creating a session. Pulumi resolves the service account's email and immutable
numeric subject; it does not create or copy a Loom token.

The `fork-ferry` mapping accepts OIDC tokens only from the `marin` repository's
`ops-fork-ferry.yaml` workflow on `main`. It authorizes the dedicated
`fork-ferry` automation profile. Loom brokers short-lived `loom-oa-dev` GitHub
App tokens for the profile's Marin fork repositories, with contents, issues,
and pull-request write access. The App key remains in `LOOM_DOTENV`; the profile
does not store a GitHub token or grant Actions access. The GitHub Pulumi stack
reads the mapping's profile from this stack's `githubFederationProfiles` output
and publishes it as the workflow's `LOOM_FORK_FERRY_PROFILE` repository variable.
The `agentic-lint` mapping authorizes the dedicated PR lint profile, and the
`agent-prose-cleanup` mapping authorizes the low-effort `prose-cleanup` profile
with a 16-session concurrency cap and a 40-turn budget, so description rewrites never
consume the shared automation pool. The remaining GitHub agent workflows have
individual federation mappings to the `github-automation` profile. Each mapping binds an exact workflow path on
`main`; the shared profile does not make other workflows eligible. Deploy the
Loom stack before the GitHub Pulumi stack so the latter can publish
`LOOM_AGENTIC_LINT_PROFILE`, `LOOM_GITHUB_AUTOMATION_PROFILE`, and
`LOOM_PROSE_CLEANUP_PROFILE`. Apply the
Loom stack before the GitHub Pulumi stack whenever these federations or profile
variables change.

Organization prompt policy lives beside the runtime profiles in
`profiles/<name>/AGENTS.md`. A profile's `instructionsFile` is resolved below
`infra/loom`, read by Pulumi, and reconciled into Loom's visible profile
`instructions` field. Loom therefore does not need access to this checkout at
runtime, and the effective text remains inspectable in Settings. The production
`slack.profile` and `github.profile` settings select their dedicated profiles;
ordinary sessions use the deployment-managed `default` profile, while workload
and future GitHub Actions callers select the automation profile authorized by
their federation mapping.

The PR review workflow launches on open, ready-for-review, and reopen events.
Reopen a PR to retry its latest head if a push invalidates an in-progress review.

The `remoteMcps` declaration registers Marina's authenticated Streamable HTTP
endpoints as the full `/marina/api` capability and the read-only
`/marina-read/api` capability. Loom passes them directly to compatible ACP
agents and mints an IAP ID token for the shared Marin desktop OAuth client from
the VM workload identity when the agent process starts. No Marina token is
stored in Pulumi state or a profile environment. Activation requires a Loom
binary that accepts remote MCP deployment entries and ACP HTTP server
descriptors; older binaries reject this manifest.

The interactive `marina` profile selects only the `marina-read` capability
group. Its instructions treat page and API content as untrusted data and forbid
seeking another route to mutate Marina data. All other production profiles
enumerate Loom's built-in groups rather than using `mcpAccess: all`, so
registering another remote endpoint cannot silently widen them. The profile
archives sessions after 50 idle minutes; an active process that outlives its
IAP token must recover before its next Marina call because ACP does not refresh
HTTP MCP headers in place.

A profile's `env` block declares the environment every session of that profile
receives. Each entry sets either an inline `value` for non-secret configuration
or a same-project `secretRef` that the host resolves from Secret Manager at launch. Declare
`roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` for each reference in
`infra/pulumi/src/iac/gcp/loom.py` before applying the profile. Profile
environment is applied after `envClear`, so strict automation profiles receive
it too. All profiles set `IRIS_USER=loom`, which makes Iris jobs submitted from
a session land under `/loom/<job>` instead of inheriting the session container's
`app` OS account.

An interactive session always brokers the `loom-oa-dev` GitHub App for its own
repository, and a stored personal token still takes precedence over it. The
`default`, `github`, and `slack` profiles therefore allowlist owners rather than
repositories: an `owner/*` entry lets a session expand into any repository under
that owner without waiting for a human decision. Each expansion is still
validated against the App's installations and recorded as a revocable grant, so
the App's installation list is what actually bounds this. Removing an owner here
does not withdraw access a session already holds.

The `fork-ferry` automation profile keeps an explicit repository list: an
automation session is stamped with its profile's entries verbatim and needs
concrete repositories to mint the cross-repository token its workflow depends
on.

The Pulumi declaration is authoritative at activation time. An unchanged
profile or remote MCP keeps its database revision; a changed declaration
overwrites the current row and advances the revision. UI or API edits persist
only until the next activation. Deployment pruning is enabled, so a
deployment-managed setting, remote MCP, profile, or federation removed from
`Pulumi.marin-loom.yaml` is removed from its deployment layer on the next
activation. Stock profiles omitted from the declaration remain unmanaged and
are not pruned; production intentionally manages `default` so interactive
instruction and runtime policy are reviewed in this repository.

At runtime, the Grafana bridge gets a Google-signed ID token from the Cloud Run
metadata server, exchanges it at `/api/auth/federate`, and uses the resulting
short-lived, profile-scoped token to create the alert session. No long-lived
Loom credential belongs in the Grafana stack or Secret Manager.

Apply the Loom stack before deploying a Grafana revision that enables a new
federated caller. This ensures the identity mapping and profile exist before the
contact point begins sending alerts. The Grafana stack consumes the URL and
profile from this stack's `workloadClients` output. `grafana-alerts` uses the
single `ops` profile; the bridge assigns trusted alert behaviors to distinct Loom
channels, so generic and Hero alerts keep separate durable coordinators while
sharing the profile's four-session concurrency pool. Every nonterminal session
explicitly launched with `ops` consumes that pool; an agent-launched child with no
explicit `--profile` uses Loom's `default` profile. Four leaves headroom for an
`ops`-profile handoff or delegated investigation while both coordinators are live,
but it does not reserve capacity for either channel. The `marin-grafana` service
account already exists in the production Grafana stack. In a new environment,
deploy Grafana once with `marin-grafana:loom_alerts` set to `false`, deploy Loom
to bind the new service account, then enable Loom alerts and redeploy Grafana.

## VM permissions

The Loom VM service account runs interactive agent sessions. Its project, secret, and KMS
grants are declared in `infra/pulumi/src/iac/gcp/loom.py` and applied by the `marin`
infrastructure stack. `Pulumi.marin-loom.yaml` contains runtime configuration only; do not add
IAM bindings to this application stack or deployment scripts. Loom reaches Echo through its IAP-gated HTTP API on Marina (`infra/marina`), which is
why the Loom VM account is an IAP accessor there. Its Cloud SQL login and the `context`
database the codehealth workbench writes to are declared by the `marin-marina` stack.

A stack cannot bootstrap access to its own secrets-provider key. An identity that already has
key access must apply the central KMS grant before Loom needs it.

Previewing Marina requires read access to its resources, Pulumi state objects, and
secrets-provider key. Deploying Marina also requires mutation access for Cloud Run,
Cloud Scheduler, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry, service accounts, and IAP settings, plus
payload access to
`cloudsql-pulumi-admin-password`. Prefer the existing project custom IAP IAM role and
secret-level access over project-wide `roles/iap.admin` or
`roles/secretmanager.admin`.

## Restart and rollback

Each Loom session supervisor runs in a separately labeled Docker container.
Recreating the control-plane service preserves those containers, and the new
control plane discovers and adopts them. Do not run `docker compose down` while
sessions are live because it removes their shared network.

To roll back an application release, check out the prior Loom tree, restore its
numbered `dotenvSecretVersion` when necessary, and run the normal preview and
update. The separately managed root disk is protected, retained if removed from
Pulumi, and not auto-deleted with the VM. A replacement root disk must use an
explicit `bootDiskSnapshot`; keep that source snapshot until a newer rollback
point has been verified.

## Scheduled watches

Declare scheduled agent or script watches under `marin-loom:watches` in
[Pulumi.marin-loom.yaml](Pulumi.marin-loom.yaml). The disabled
`weekday-job-check` entry shows agent configuration. Use `promptFile` for prompts
stored under `infra/loom`; Pulumi includes their contents in the manifest.

Deploy [Loom's scheduled-watch support](https://github.com/marin-community/loom/pull/378)
before applying these declarations. See [Loom's watch documentation](https://github.com/marin-community/loom/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#scheduled-watches)
for scheduling and execution behavior, and [WatchConfig](infrastructure.py) for
the IaC fields. Custom script files must already exist on the Loom server.
