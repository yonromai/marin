"""Panel views over eval records, built on the shared statistics engine.

Every score the dashboard shows is a :class:`~marin.evaluation.eval_stats.Measurement`: a value, the
items behind it, and an interval that widens when a run graded less than it attempted. This module
turns records into measurements, answers a :class:`~marin.evaluation.eval_stats.SelectionRequest`
with them, and shapes the result for the API -- the statistics and the selection rules live in the
engine, which the eval runners share, so the dashboard and the producers cannot drift.

Presentation lives here: the suite grouping of columns, the family grouping that collapses several
settings of one benchmark into a single column, the smoke-suite exclusion, and the payload shapes. A
cell the request rejected is kept as a *missing* entry with the reason, so an empty cell is explained
rather than blank.
