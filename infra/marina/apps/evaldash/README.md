# EvalDash

A benchmark panel and browsable run log over every Marin eval run, served by the Marina kernel at
`/evaldash/`.

Eval runs write one canonical JSON record per run under `gs://marin-eval-metadata/evals` for GCP or
`s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/evals` for CoreWeave. The run directory also holds the evaluator's
results and per-sample artifacts. The app's own Postgres schema is the serving catalog: it loads the
full validated record snapshot before answering, and object storage stays the durable producer and
recovery input. The EvalDash Marina runner scans object storage and commits catalog changes; serving
instances do no background reconciliation work.
The runner writes through the database engine without loading a serving snapshot. Catalog
materialization reads and writes at most 128 run IDs per batch within the prefix transaction.
Object checks finish before that transaction begins; parsed records from those checks remain in
memory until commit.
Historical records may omit `model.config.tokenizer_revision`; the record reader treats an omitted
value as `None`. Current writers include the field.

The default scan also includes the former flat `gs://marin-eval-metadata/runs` and
`s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/eval-metadata/runs` roots because older CLI checkouts still write there.
Canonical `evals` roots have precedence when the same migrated `run_id` exists in both locations.

Record discovery runs every 10 minutes using a delimiter-based directory listing and checks only
`*/record.json`. It does not recursively enumerate results, samples, trajectories, or other evaluator
payloads. New record bodies are read with up to 16 concurrent requests. Known objects carry a GCS
generation, S3 ETag, or local content hash in the PostgreSQL source inventory; their first recheck is
spread across the first day, then each is HEADed once per 24 hours and reread only when its version
changes. A missing object must be absent on two successful checks before its source is removed. A
failed prefix listing leaves that prefix's last committed rows untouched, and an invalid rewrite keeps
the last valid record while surfacing the error on the Debug page. Failures in a serving instance's
generation check or the scheduled reconciliation pass remain visible there until a later check or
pass succeeds.

Each source change and its selected `eval_catalog_runs`/`eval_catalog_metrics` projection commit in one
transaction. The lowest configured prefix priority wins duplicate run IDs, so a removed canonical
record promotes its legacy copy without rereading it. The transaction advances
`eval_catalog_state.generation`. Each serving instance checks that generation at most once every 10
seconds and swaps its in-memory aggregate views only after a newer generation commits. A failed check
serves the last good snapshot and retries after the same interval. `marina migrate` applies the
pending numbered migrations from `migrations/` under a
PostgreSQL advisory lock and rejects a database whose migration ledger is newer than the running
binary; mounting the app only verifies the schema, and never writes. The initial migration adopts the
pre-migration tables; the next seeds separate catalog projection tables so an overlapping old revision
cannot mutate the new commit-token state. Seeded serving rows are not pruned until every configured
prefix has completed one successful inventory, and an unavailable higher-priority prefix cannot let a
lower-priority duplicate replace a seeded row during that first inventory.

The SPA has four views: the panel (one row per model, one column per benchmark, each cell a score
with its 95% interval and coverage badge, plus a suite column tree, run-metadata filters, a cohort
selector, an opt-in qualified aggregate, and archive controls), runs (a "by launch" grouped view
expanding each serve group to its evals, plus a flat filterable table), run detail (grade with its
interval and ungraded-item breakdown, metrics, version + description, live iris job/attempt status,
live finelog logs, a per-sample browser, and group siblings), and status (per-prefix ingest probes).

Model detail links record the selected cohort in `?cohort=`, including `all` and `unversioned`,
so reopening a link restores the same runs and scores. Links without a cohort resolve to the
dashboard's default cohort and add it to the URL.

The per-sample browser shows how each prediction was graded (the grader method, headline metric,
score, and verbatim grader detail) and highlights the picked-versus-gold answer. Agentic (Harbor)
samples reference a step trajectory by URI; the browser lazy-loads it through the artifact endpoint
and renders the agent's turns, tool calls, observations, and reward. A sample's one unbounded
payload, the trajectory, lives as an archive blob referenced by URI, so paging the light columns
never materializes it.

The sample and artifact endpoints accept both FineStore format v2 and format v1 during the writer
rollout. V2 reads are pinned to `HEAD`. V1 reads use `finestore.migrations.LegacyReadView`, which
captures the listed shards without modifying the archive and therefore has no commit token. Current
writers produce v2. Remove the v1 path after every known eval runtime image has moved to v2 and four
weekly fleet inventories find no sealed v1 archives and no additions to the documented terminal
unsealed-v1 set. Run the inventory over every record root EvalDash scans:

```bash
uv run python -m experiments.evaluation.migrations.cli smoke-upgrade-fleet --mode inventory \
  --records-prefix gs://marin-eval-metadata/evals \
  --records-prefix s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/evals \
  --records-prefix gs://marin-eval-metadata/runs \
  --records-prefix s3://marin-us-east-02a/marin/eval-metadata/runs
```

The kernel is the only access gate; there is no application auth. Handlers read the caller through
`rigging.server_auth.get_verified_identity`.

`/panel` answers one selection request against the statistics engine in
`marin.evaluation.eval_stats`, which the eval runners share, so the dashboard and the producers apply
the same rules. Every cell is a measurement: the rate over the items a run graded, the item counts
behind it, the per-cause counts of items it attempted and never graded, and a 95% interval. When a run
reports an attempted count, the interval covers the ungraded items by Manski bounds with an
Imbens-Manski critical value rather than imputing them; when it reports none, the interval is labelled
`sampling_only`, because completeness is then unknown. A panel benchmark column sorts on the score;
`/compare` ranks on the interval's lower bound, so losing items cannot buy rank there. Each row's
`last_updated` is the maximum `created_at` among its cells.

Both evaluators emit benchmark metadata with the full item count, the count selected after a run cap,
and the canonical metric protocol. Marin preserves that block in `record.json`. Harbor reports task
counts there; Marin multiplies them by the configured trials per task when it records coverage. The
per-sample rows still carry the pass tally and the count of items whose grader extracted no answer. A
cell every one of whose graded items yielded no
extractable answer is flagged `no_answers`. Such a result is held out of the panel by default rather
than standing as a model's newest score -- the zero is real but is equally consistent with a broken
grader, and reporting a collapse on that basis would be the same error as hiding it. The empty cell
names the flag and links the run, and `include_flagged=1` admits it, starred.

Several settings of one benchmark can share a leaderboard column. The launcher writes explicit
groupings to each run's `eval.family`. Harbor runs without an explicit family use their dataset as the
family, so policies and dataset versions over the same benchmark group automatically. Other runs
without a family keep their own column. `/panel` returns each family, its requested variants, and the
selected variant. It selects the variant with the most admitted cells for that request, breaking ties
by eval name. Requesting one variant pins it.

The response's `panel` contains one selected variant per family and controls coverage, `complete=1`,
and aggregation. `benchmarks` and `cells` retain every admitted variant under its exact eval name.
The SPA stores its panel selection locally. The Compare route carries the selected variants in its
URL, and `/meta` lists siblings omitted from a narrowed panel so the picker can restore them.

The evaluator names each task's primary metric, its canonical spelling, and whether its observations
are binary or continuous. A column's protocol comes from the newest record with evaluator metadata;
a cell whose metric or kind differs is rejected rather than ranked against unlike numbers. Records
written before this metadata existed use their prior metric-selection rules and canonical aliases so
their columns remain populated while benchmarks are rerun.

The scored `/panel` and `/compare` APIs default to `cohort=eval-policy-2026-09-24-verified`.
The home screen reads and writes `cohort` in the URL, including the resolved default. Navigation
and model-detail links preserve it. Model rows, benchmark protocols, and missing-cell explanations
belong to the selected cohort. Compare offers only models with at least one admitted non-zero score
in the selected cohort and benchmarks.

Historical cohort labels remain selectable. `cohort=all` selects the newest admissible run per
benchmark across cohorts for browsing; model comparison is disabled and the `/compare` API rejects
it. The UI marks all-cohort and unverified historical views with an asterisk because their settings
are not verified as comparable. A named verified cohort admits only records with its approved
benchmark config, evaluator revision, and thinking mode. Models with different normalized source
YAMLs have separate comparison names ending in `@<12-character digest>`.

Within the selected cohort, each benchmark uses the newest run that clears the request's admission rules
(`min_coverage`, default 0.9, and a succeeded status). `min_benchmark_coverage`, also 0.9, is the share
of the benchmark the run set out to grade; a capped run whose benchmark size is unrecorded is never
admitted. The corresponding rejection reasons report low benchmark coverage, an unreported benchmark
size for a capped run, or a metric protocol mismatch. A cohort may contain only a subset of
its benchmarks. A `(model, benchmark)` with no admitted cell is reported in `missing` with the reason
and the offending run. Policy-rejected runs are reported separately with their model, benchmark,
run ID, and reasons, scoped to the selected cohort and filters.
`complete=1` keeps only models covering every selected benchmark. No cross-benchmark aggregate is
produced unless `aggregate=` names a missing-data policy (`require_complete` or `bound`), and one that
is produced carries its panel, per-benchmark metrics, and policy. An unusable query value (an unknown
aggregate policy, a `min_coverage` outside `[0, 1]`) is a 400 rather than a silent fallback to a
different question. Archived models (a `model_state` side table the ingestor never touches) drop out
unless `include_archived=1`.

The `/panel` response also returns `protocols`, keyed by benchmark, with the declared metric and kind
used to admit its cells.

`/compare` answers the ordering question the panel cannot: per benchmark, the model with the
highest interval lower bound leads, and every other model gets an interval for its gap to that leader,
folding in both runs' sampling error and both runs' ungraded items (asymmetrically -- the opposing
run's missing items are what can move your bound). A gap interval that spans zero means these runs
cannot resolve the ordering, which is weaker than the models being equal. Its single ranking number is
the aggregate over the shared benchmarks only, under `require_complete`.

`/meta` echoes the caller the kernel authenticated as `current_user`, groups the eval columns into
suites for the column tree, lists every variant each benchmark family has been run under, and lists
the filter facets a panel request accepts.

The `jobs` and `logs` endpoints use generated Connect clients to reach the Iris controller and
finelog hub by internal IP over Direct VPC egress. GCE instance discovery requires
`roles/compute.viewer` on the runtime service account. Outside the VPC (local dev) they return a `reachable: false`
payload rather than erroring, so the dashboard shows "unreachable" and falls back to the log
tails recorded on the run.

The `samples/artifact` endpoint resolves a sample's `trajectory_uri` through fsspec,
restricted to URIs under the run's own `results_path` -- a `..` segment or an out-of-tree URI is
refused, so the endpoint cannot fetch arbitrary object storage. It size-caps each read and, like the
logs endpoint, returns a typed `{available: false, reason}` for a missing, unreadable, or oversized
object rather than a 500. Reads are cached briefly, as sample tables are.

`/models/{model}` aggregates in one call everything the Model view needs: the model's identity from
its newest record, one cohort entry per distinct version (newest first), each eval's score-over-time
with `-smoke` suites excluded, and every run for the model (smoke included), newest first, each with
its headline measurement.

`/runs/{run_id}/samples/review` samples up to `n` (default 20, capped at 40) rows of the run's
`{task}` filtered by `{filter}` (`all`/`correct`/`incorrect`), renders each into a bounded text digest,
and asks one Claude call (`EVALDASH_REVIEW_MODEL`, default `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, keyed by
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) to bucket them into a fixed failure-mode rubric with a short narrative. Like the
logs and artifact endpoints it returns `{available: false, reason}` -- never a 500 -- when the
`anthropic` SDK is missing, the key is unset, the task has no matching samples, or the reply is not
valid JSON.

## Configuration

Resolved once when the kernel mounts the app, from the environment:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RECORDS_PREFIXES` | the four roots above | Comma-separated record roots, highest precedence first. |
| `EVALDASH_STORE` | `postgres` | `local` serves from the record snapshot with no database. |
| `EVALDASH_INGEST_INTERVAL` | `600` | Local-store polling cadence. Production uses the manifest's ten-minute schedule. |
| `EVALDASH_INGEST_JOB` | unset | Full Cloud Run job resource queued by `POST /refresh`; Marina derives it from the manifest in production. |
| `EVALDASH_REVALIDATE_AFTER` | `86400` | Seconds before a known object is rechecked. |
| `EVALDASH_REVIEW_MODEL` | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` | The model behind `samples/review`. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | unset | Without it the review endpoint degrades rather than failing. |

The database is the kernel's: `marina.db` hands the app an engine on the `evaldash` schema. There is
no EvalDash-specific database configuration.

## Develop

Serve synthetic fixture records locally without a database or cloud credentials. Isolate
EvalDash from other Marina apps, which may require a database. Live job and log panels show
"unreachable".

Run from the repository root:

```bash
cd infra/marina
uv run marina build --only evaldash
preview_records=$(mktemp -d /tmp/evaldash-records.XXXXXX)
preview_apps=$(mktemp -d /tmp/evaldash-apps.XXXXXX)
ln -s "$PWD/apps/evaldash" "$preview_apps/evaldash"
uv run python -m apps.evaldash.fixtures "$preview_records"
EVALDASH_STORE=local RECORDS_PREFIXES="$preview_records" \
  uv run marina dev --apps-dir "$preview_apps"
# -> http://127.0.0.1:8080/evaldash/
```

Click `Rescan` to load the records. Fixture cohorts predate verified policies; select
`Newest per benchmark (all cohorts)*` to view them. To inspect real
runs, point `RECORDS_PREFIXES` at a local copy of their run directories. Keep dev storage
local to avoid production writes. After frontend edits, rerun `marina build --only evaldash`
and reload the browser; this command does not hot-reload the frontend.

For a Postgres-backed preview, generate fixtures as above, then run from `infra/marina`:

```bash
export MARINA_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+pg8000://postgres:marina@127.0.0.1:5432/marina
uv run marina migrate --only evaldash
EVALDASH_STORE=postgres RECORDS_PREFIXES="$preview_records" \
  uv run marina dev --apps-dir "$preview_apps"
```

## Test

```bash
cd infra/marina
uv run pytest apps/evaldash                          # unit tests; starts a throwaway pgvector container
MARINA_DATABASE_URL=... uv run marina journey evaldash   # the browser walk, screenshots under journeys-out/
```

The image needs more than the kernel: `marin.evaluation`'s four record and statistics modules, the
generated `iris.rpc`/`finelog.rpc` packages, and `lib/finestore`. `infra/marina/Dockerfile` copies
them and `Dockerfile.dockerignore` allows them into the build context.
